 * Per-tick boat movement. Full sail moves the boat's base speed, set by its hull (the wiki's
 * base speeds: wooden 1.5 tiles a tick, teak 2, camphor 2.5); half sail moves half that,
 * turning or not. The turn rate comes from rsmod's
 * `BoatMovement.kt` and its live traces (https://github.com/rsmod/rsmod, ISC license): 128
 * angle units a tick.
 *
 * Unlike rsmod, reverse keeps the bow on the helm heading and backs up at half speed instead
 * of turning the boat around.
