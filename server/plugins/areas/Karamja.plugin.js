/**
 * Karamja area interactions: the way down through the Karamja volcano to the TzHaar city.

 * - Rocks at 2856,3168 > Climb-down: into the volcano dungeon, below the side the player stands
 *   on (rsprox captures: from 2855,3168 to 2855,9568 and from 2858,3168 to 2858,9568, on the
 *   tick, with no animation).
 * - Cave entrance at 2863,9571 > Enter: the TzHaar city at 2480,5175 (the tile the city's exit
 *   is used from in the captures; the entrance itself has none).
 * - Climbing rope at 2856,9569 > Climb: back up beside the rocks, on the side the player
 *   climbs from (no capture; it mirrors the way down). It only goes up, so Ladders isn't left
 *   to ask which way.
