/**
 * Saniboch (tribesman_doorman) and the Brimhaven Dungeon entrance (dungeon_tree_closed), as the
 * OSRS Wiki and rsprox recordings (227/70, 234/3275 and the entrance's 9) have them:
 *
 * - The fee: 875 coins for one visit, or 1,000,000 coins once for permanent access, carried in
 *   the inventory. Paying sets karam_dungeon_entryfee or karam_dungeon_permanentaccess; both sit
 *   in karam_dungeon_doordata, which turns the entrance from Pay into Enter.
 * - Talk-to plays his transcript (npc-dialogues.json "Saniboch"); this unit answers its
 *   conditions and takes the coins on its payment lines, which show in an item box with coins.
 * - Pay, on Saniboch or on the entrance, plays his right-click variants: with permanent access
 *   or a visit paid he lets the player in; without 875 coins he sends them off; with less than
 *   1,000,000 it is "Pay 875 coins to enter?"; otherwise the three-way menu the recordings show.
 * - Enter: the pick-up animation, and a tick later the player is inside at (2713, 9564, 0). A
 *   visit paid once is used up by going in; permanent access stays.
