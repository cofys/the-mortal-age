// Fighting from a boat's deck with ordinary weapons (Wiki: Boat combat): a player aboard can
// attack sea creatures with ranged and magic, measured from where the boat is on the sea (core's
// CombatPosition), but not with melee, and nothing ashore. Core leaves any fight across a deck to
// content, so this says yes to those and nothing else. Only from the player's own boat: a creature
// fights back by attacking that boat (Creatures.SeaCombat.js), which another ship's deck isn't.
// A global hook, as the rule spans two areas (a deck and the sea); its first checks are the cheap
// ones, so attacks elsewhere pass through at once.
