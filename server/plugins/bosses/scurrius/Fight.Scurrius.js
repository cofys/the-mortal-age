/**
 * Scurrius' fight (Wiki: Scurrius, Scurrius/Strategies), timed and animated from the rsprox
 * captures (docs/scurrius.md):
 * - phase one: tail swipes in melee, three attacks in ten a stomp that drops rubble, and only
 *   stomps while his target is out of reach, walking in on them (every 4 ticks);
 * - at 80% he runs to one of the three food piles and eats there: three to five heals of 5 or
 *   10 per player in the room, each just before an attack (every 6 or 7 ticks), while he throws
 *   magic and fur balls, stomps and calls six giant rats; then he walks two tiles off, swipes
 *   three to five times (no stomps) and goes back to the pile to eat again, until 30%;
 * - at 30% he runs to the middle of the room and keeps to magic, ranged, stomps and rats (every
 *   4 ticks), turning only to stomp at his target's tile, and goes back to eating if he heals
 *   above 30%;
 * - the rubble: twelve tiles, one under each player, the rest anywhere on the floor, landing nine
 *   ticks after the stomp for 15-22 (solo) or 15-24 (public);
 * - the rats: at most twelve waves, and none while his last ones live; any hit from a player
 *   kills one, and rat bone weapons hit them without an attack delay.
