 * Champions' Challenge: what the units share - the plugin api, plugins/minigames/data/

 * Progress is two bit sets, one bit per champion (`bit` in the data): the champions beaten and
 * the lamps rubbed. Varp 617 carries both, as the cache lays it out: champions_defeated_* (and
 * champions_slain) in bits 0-15, champions_lamps in bits 16-31. The banners on the Wall of
 * Defeated Champions and the Chest of Champions are multilocs on those varbits.
