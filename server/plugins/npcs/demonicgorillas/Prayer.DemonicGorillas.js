/**
 * A demonic gorilla's protection prayer (Wiki, rsprox captures):
 *
 * - It protects against one style, shown by which of its three ids it is, and a hit in that
 *   style does nothing. Verac's set gets through, and so do the ancient mace and dragon sword
 *   specials (22 October 2025 update); other special attacks don't.
 * - Once it has taken four damaging hits and 70 damage in styles it doesn't protect against,
 *   it protects against the style of the hit that took it there: it changes id and beats its
 *   chest on the same tick.
 *
 * Hits are checked as they are queued, so a blocked hit gives no XP, and again as they land,
 * so a hit already on its way when it changes prayer does nothing either.
