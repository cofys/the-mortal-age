/**
 * Throne of Miscellania (members).
 *
 * The words come from the "Throne of Miscellania" transcript page; this plugin
 * supplies the variant selector for King Vargas, Queen Sigrid, Prince Brand,
 * Princess Astrid, Advisor Ghrim, the throne-room guard and Derrik, the start
 * hook (with the requirements gate), the courtship gift hand-ins, the peace
 * treaty chain (anthem -> correction -> treaty -> giant pen), the public
 * support phase and the final ceremony.
 *
 * Stages (varp 359, "misc_quest" in the cache varp dump; the wiki publishes no
 * per-stage values, so the numbering follows Quest Helper's
 * VarPlayerID.MISC_QUEST-driven guide, the only published reference): 10
 * started (court the chosen heir), 20 heir trust gained (negotiate peace with
 * Queen Sigrid), 30 Sigrid asks for recognition (report to King Vargas), 40
 * Vargas wants the Etceterian anthem changed (report to Sigrid), 50 Sigrid
 * wants a new anthem (Prince Brand writes the awful anthem, Advisor Ghrim
 * corrects it), 60 good anthem in hand (show it to Sigrid), 70 Sigrid's signed
 * treaty (show it to Vargas), 80 Vargas needs a giant pen (Derrik's nib on
 * logs), 90 pen signed, gain 75% public support, 100 complete. 100 is pinned
 * by the cache itself: Ghrim (3670, transformVarp 359) transforms to 5447 for
 * every value below 100 and to 5448 - his post-quest "Collect" form - at
 * exactly 100; Quest Helper's last guided stage is 90.
 *
 * Side state lives in persisted attributes and is mirrored to the cache's own
 * side varbits (confirmed with `lookup-gameval varbit misc`): 72 misc_approval
 * (varp 361 bits 18-24), 73 misc_affection (25-31), 14606 misc_acceptedtorule
 * (varp 362 bit 28) and 14607 misc_partner_multivar (varp 363 bit 29; 1 =
 * Prince Brand, 0 = Princess Astrid per Quest Helper). The wiki's s1/s2/s3
 * courtship dialogue progress is our own persisted bitfield.
 *
 * Requirements per the OSRS Wiki: The Fremennik Trials and Heroes' Quest
 * complete, both gated with quest:is-complete on the "Yes." start hook (the
 * dump has no "lacks the requirements" condition). There are no hard skill
 * requirements; the wiki's Woodcutting/Mining/Fishing/Farming levels only
 * unlock the optional support-gaining methods. Rewards per the wiki: 1 Quest
 * point and access to Managing Miscellania (10,000 coins inside the coffers,
 * ring of wealth teleport).
 *
 * Gaps / approximations:
 *  - The Emotes plugin claims the emote interface button, so emote clicks
 *    cannot be observed (the same limitation LostTribe documents). The
 *    courtship emote steps are folded into talks/gifts: the dance/clap gates
 *    are skipped, and the "blow kiss" gate is the "Hello, dear."/"Good day"
 *    greeting talk after the third set of dialogues.
 *  - Advisor Ghrim spawns as the nameless transform parent 3670 (varp 359
 *    drives it to 5447/5448), which is what the dialogue index and this
 *    selector key on.
 *  - The Managing Miscellania reward system (coffers, approval interface,
 *    daily collection) does not exist in this server: the post-quest
 *    open_interface action answers with a system message and the 10,000 coins
 *    stay a completion-scroll line only. Ring of Wealth's Miscellania
 *    teleport is not quest-gated (separate plugin).
 *  - Public support starts at 25% when the pen is signed and every coal/maple
 *    /fishing action on the islands adds 5% (the wiki's rate is roughly 1%
 *    per action over ~55 actions). Raking flax/herbs is not hooked because
 *    farming emits no rake event.
 *  - The wiki's "[number]%" and "[Fremennik name]" blanks are filled from
 *    state and the player name; "{{...}}" annotations are stripped from lines.
 *  - If the player declines at the start, the transcript's acceptance lines
 *    are dropped but its heir-choice menu still shows; the quest simply does
 *    not start.
 *  - The guard's Heroes' Quest condition (QSsVp6) only has its "may pass"
 *    branch in the dump, so it is always answered true.
 *  - Gifts are consumed as their hand-over dialogue starts (declining the
 *    "Yes"/marriage prompt still loses them), and items granted with a full
 *    inventory are not dropped to the ground as the wiki annotations say.
