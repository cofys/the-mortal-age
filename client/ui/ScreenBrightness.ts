/**
 * The Settings "Screen brightness" slider: OSRS keeps it as device option 6, on the client (no
 * varp, and no cache script reads the old `option_brightness` varp 166 any more).
 *
 * Cache script 3966 writes it as `clamp(0, 100, slider * 5)` and 3961 reads it back as `/ 5`, so
 * it is 0..100 in steps of 5. The renderer's brightness is OSRS's gamma exponent (colours are
 * `pow(rgb, gamma)`; the four classic levels were 0.9 darkest to 0.6 brightest), so the slider
 * maps 0..100 linearly onto that range. Kept in localStorage, like the interface scaling.
