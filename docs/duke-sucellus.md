# Postquest Duke Sucellus

The members-only plugin implements the repeatable normal encounter after Desert Treasure II. Completed players can skip Ghorrock Prison through the heavy door and enter an owner-only asylum. Leaving, disconnecting or dying clears temporary supplies; login recovery returns abandoned instance characters outside the gate. Awakened entry is unavailable and cannot consume an orb.

## Current behavior

Vats accept partial ingredients and hand-crush raw mushrooms one-for-one. A complete six-of-each recipe ferments for six ticks. Check uses the captured ingredient messagebox; Empty refunds the stored amounts atomically. A full inventory preserves the vat and its contents. Picking and grinding repeat until interrupted; mining uses the selected pickaxe interval and stops after five minutes. The iron pickaxe yields first after seven server processing steps and repeats every seven ticks. Tick manipulation and unmeasured pickaxe tiers are not claimed exact.

The June/July 2025 preparation changes remain: eight mushroom picks, resources retained between kills, level-dependent powder yields, five-point powder feeding once per tick, two normal poison doses and 10 Herblore XP per poison. Feeding displays a separate green preparation meter and hitsplats; it cannot queue combat damage against the awakened boss. The final feed wakes him on the next tick. Resource objects become inactive during combat.

Normal combat uses 485 HP, five-tick attacks and four-tick enrage attacks at 121 HP. Melee shows the seven-tile row at launch, applies chip on that cycle and checks the aimed slam two ticks later. Magic launches from the mouth with cycles50/120, raw height350 to100, and applies damage four ticks later. Its slot2 impact is sent at cast time with delay120. Gaze checks cover after five ticks and applies failed-gaze damage one tick later; the captured warning/success colors and failure text remain. Eyes animate in place and wake with the Duke. Freeze feedback retains its captured slots, graphics and message.

Preparation and combat gas use private vent NPCs. Preparation eyes, cones, icefalls and gas retain the later timing/geometry corrections. Every owned boss, timer, vent and cone has `combat:no-regen` before being added to the instance, through removal. Wake, death, exit and respawn clear the appropriate scheduled effects and actors.

Kill time freezes at lethal damage. Counts, personal/world records and novice grave discounts persist. The drop roller receives the exact dead boss's perfect-kill context. Cold Feet tracks actual running, including preparation, and resets at lethal damage for the next attempt. Mirror Image compares actual player and Duke attack-launch cycles. Five-perfect-kill and speed achievements remain; any observed Slayer assignment excludes speed awards. The native scoreboard requires quest completion.

The later audit decoded [1751](https://rsprox.net/download/1751), [1827](https://rsprox.net/download/1827) and [3285](https://rsprox.net/download/3285) with the same official source and launcher1.0.5. These are Leagues V/Grid Master worlds. Duke level758 identifies normal variants in the former;3285's level1099 and370-point meter identify awakened Duke and are excluded from normal mechanics. Event worlds corroborate presentation, not normal damage, XP, yields or player attack rates. No ordinary-world postquest packet recording was found.

Retained normal-variant presentation includes independent eye clocks (middle/south/north, two-tick stagger), three-vent preparation groups every25ticks, two combat spits three ticks apart, native poison/vat headbars and a24tick corpse/respawn boundary. Combat vent holders spawn two ticks after the spit, warn for one tick, then damage from holder+2 until their empirical12–14tick lifetime ends. This supersedes the older quest-holder visual schedule; it does not establish exact current normal damage or lifetime RNG.

Ordinary footage and primary descriptions constrain the remaining geometry and gathering behavior:

- [Salt tick-manipulation clip](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/images/Duke_Sucellus_-_tick_manip_%28salt%29.mp4?2237c), SHA256 `df88a1965f84f0d1ff052a699a7f4194938ea0cb5e0c9cbe3e10173024b1377f`, and [mushroom clip](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/images/Duke_Sucellus_-_tick_manip_%28mushroom%29.mp4?dda52), SHA256 `87efba562a0cf63f2e49013681e9e0660fae88e1298c8fe6e0185b381d147a82`: manipulated gathering does not establish every ordinary pickaxe interval.
- [Extremity](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Extremity), the [quest walkthrough](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Desert_Treasure_II_-_The_Fallen_Empire?oldid=15374592#Duking_it_Out) and [running-past clip](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/images/Duke_Sucellus_-_running_past_extremities.mp4?c9b16): the rotated3×2 wall object leaves cone rows1/3/5, with safe mushroom tiles.
- Ordinary [Extile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QjdtcregEQ), [Theoatrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0GroGCHNlI), [TheEdB0ys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HozIDuwMShw) and [10Boot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1V5U4E20pY) footage supplied the original follow-up's gathering, coverage and timing bounds; narration is not an exact server-tick measurement.

Still provisional: normal poison amount per dose, protected magic24/covered gas4 maxima, exact icefall RNG, combat gas lifetime distribution, extremity check timing and unmeasured gathering tiers/tick manipulation. A seven-tile visual does not establish a seven-tile damaging slam. Quest/event damage samples do not replace current normal maxima. Awakened hazards and achievements remain unavailable.

## Validation

The integration retains the ancestry of PR891 `16a1b9e6108d04d5912f69eaba1eee650ffa30ac` and PR895 `18c98d340476b762aa41dd381e7301624d60c5a1`. Named asylum hooks and the exact guarded unnamed Ghorrock fallback remain. Source-generated JSON is unchanged from main; the conditional-drop dependency is already merged.

Tests use actual cache definitions, inventories, templated areas, NPC processing/death tasks and hit queues. They cover the later mechanics alongside partial vat refunds, messageboxes, cast-time impacts, gaze/freeze feedback, real idle regeneration and auxiliary cleanup. The own-worktree MCP smoke entered the asylum, fed two poisons, observed485HP wake, retained a lowered300HP boss, and verified exit cleanup. Client animation feel and current ordinary-world packet parity were not visually retested. Final build/suite totals are in the integration PR.

## One strike calculation and terminal cancellation, 24 October 2026

The former strike helper constructed a dummy zero PendingHit, then rolled the
actual damage through applyStyleDamage. Real Elysian tests reproduced two effect
invocations for one melee or magic strike. The [primary shield description](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Elysian_spirit_shield)
ties its effect to the damage calculation and places recoil after its reduction.

Each strike now constructs one actual pre-rolled PendingHit, preserving the
existing inclusive range, accuracy settings, selected protected range, HP cap
and queue reveal cycle. The optional protection-bypass flag reviewed in
[PR #996](https://github.com/RSPSApp/tsps/pull/996) prevents ordinary full prayer
blocking from being reapplied to Duke's already chosen protected range. The
source branch includes that exact generic prerequisite separately so it remains
buildable while #996 is open; it includes no Whisperer feature changes.

Pending strikes are tracked alongside their parts. Terminal cancellation zeroes
both the parts and cached totals used by retaliation, and applied hits release
their references. Before correction, real Vengeance was consumed despite zero
HP loss after stop/fell. A late strike invoked after stop could also deal damage;
the helper now rejects inactive terminal/ended/replaced encounters and dead
players. Ordinary hazard damage retains its separate path.

Seven new regressions cover actual Elysian effects for both styles, cancellation
of recoil/Vengeance, a late stopped strike, protected magic with post-shield
retaliation, and non-reflecting hazard controls. Fresh prerequisite build and all
106 Duke plus 7 HitQueue checks pass (113/113); independent review repeated them
and found no important issue. Full/native/integration verification is recorded
in the PR. This does not establish new damage bounds, RNG draw order, vent/ice
selection or combat timing constants.
