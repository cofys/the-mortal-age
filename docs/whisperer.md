# The Whisperer

The members-only plugin owns the postquest normal encounter after Desert Treasure II. A completed player needs a real Blackstone fragment; the bank placeholder does not qualify. Ketla's generated reclaim conversation grants a lost plain fragment at its handout step. The owner-only private cathedral includes both realms, inherits cache clipping and preserves each approach tile. North/south wakes push three tiles away from the figure; no east/west/diagonal displacement is invented. Public rope/teleporter access uses named hooks independently of quest progress.

## Current behavior

Normal combat has900HP, threshold specials at720/495/270, impact-time prayer checks, increasingly mixed three-projectile volleys, static four-tile tentacle rays, mirrored melee hits, binding pursuit, sanity/prayer changes and140HP enrage. Each shot animates its alternating hand and uses fixed cycles30/90 with raw heights350/100. Launched shots survive a later melee recovery or phase transition; final death, departure and stop cancel all remaining encounter damage. Tentacles show spawn/attack/path/hit/removal at+0/+1/+2/+3/+4, with one hit per wave across realm transfers.

Specials retain teleport preparation and actor materialization at+6 seeds/+5 columns/+4 souls. Seeds use all four24/28-tile patterns and40ticks after materialization. Screech uses eight20/40/60HP columns, native40-pixel headbar2 and blasts at+17/+23/+29. Water-wave graphics, delayed column projectile/HP impacts and removal remain separate phases. Souls use twelve one-HP actors in2/3/3/4 sets, vulnerable in shadow, with per-set rewards. Completing a special emits depletion/result messages. Fragment switching begins with materialization; screech closes switching at+14.

Binding uses the melee transformation, cast sequence10254 and cast/impact graphics177/2466. Captured Chebyshev distances3/4/5-or-more select200/180/170cycles; the corresponding impact occurs at+7/+6/+6. A real freeze counter cancels the impact and releases the player. After the third special, below100HP cancels pursuit and restores autos two ticks later while preserving the launched bind's original deadline. Crossing the next special threshold replaces the post-special bind. No optional-bind skip probability is invented.

Every owned boss, figure, tentacle, column and soul has `combat:no-regen` before area ownership through removal. Final death freezes kill time, restores sanity and grades actual avoidable damage; protected melee chip preserves perfection. Death/exit/logout removes actors and resets realm/HUD state. Counts, PBs, first-five-kill grave discounts, native personal/world statistics and normal combat achievements persist. Slayer assignments exclude speed awards. Awakened entry and achievements remain unavailable.

## Remaining source limits

This is functional normal content, not complete1:1 parity. The28–42 melee distribution, floored two-thirds protected share, zero-sanity damage ramp, column-health distribution beyond published guarantees, bind selection, exact freeze expiry and distances below3 remain provisional. General east/west/diagonal wake behavior is unmeasured. Wiki30tick respawn remains despite shorter historical/event observations. Soul-result branches beyond no/some/all completed sets remain unverified. Awakened mechanics are not offered.

## Integration and validation

The branch retains PR893 `a92357d8add71092ec5618f710e1f5b6744cca1c` and PR896 `ca5a794d7fda0bcf39491d1e32b6cc94566708ad`. Named transport/fragment hooks, generated Ketla dialogue integration, messages, visited varbit and colored duration/PB output coexist with the later phase/achievement/record work. Only unnamed scoreboard parents need a guarded generic fallback. Source-generated JSON is unchanged from main.

Tests use real cache definitions, players, NPC processing, inventories, private areas and hit queues. Added integration regressions preserve launched volleys during melee recovery and cancel them on stop; existing real-NPC clocks verify boss/column/soul HP. The own-worktree MCP smoke verified north6371→6374 wake,900HP boss, a threshold screech with all eight columns, and exit reset of realm/HUD with no visible encounter actors. Client animation feel was not visually retested. Final build/suite totals are in the integration PR.


### Whole-footprint diagonal pursuit regression (24 October 2026)

The local release d583823ab still restricted diagonal movement to size-one actors,
while upstream065d29b68 already permits all sizes when their entire footprint can
travel. This is an observable normal Whisperer movement gap, separate from choosing
an unmeasured binding duration. Two real MovementQueue regressions now cover it.

Original [RSProx recording3285](https://rsprox.net/download/3285) has normal actor12205
walk from2655,6360 at23066 to2654,6361 at23067 and2653,6362 at23068. The player remains
at2649,6369. The recording belongs to an altered world; these NPC coordinates establish
geometry only, not an ordinary freeze timer, damage roll or probability. Capture
SHA2568cfd915cc9172769c3b871b17640f5b6141468f8e3796abf75d3ff461dace3da;
filtered derived stream SHA256fb8225e522011e3311443d6a80e86581ea74d81300eaf2343f19549733110864.
No player names, chat, saves or raw video are included in the regression.

The first test asserts the NPC's size remains3 through transformation and follows
both recorded steps using actual cache clipping. A second overlays an obstruction
at2654,6363 in its private area: this blocks the diagonal's outer3x3 corner while
leaving the cardinal west fallback open. It must square that corner, not pass
through it. The old size-one guard was temporarily restored and rebuilt: the first
regression failed at2654,6360 instead of2654,6361; restoring upstream and rebuilding
passes both. The upstream change is regression-only; the local integration selects
just the already-merged generic guard correction and excludes unrelated movement,
raid, client and generated-data changes.

This audit also reacquired two original ordinary videos: ManaCharge's [full kill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqwJCArI818)
(uploaded15August2023) explicitly uses freeze counters; ImperatorBTW's [three tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_WV8Wbhv4s)
(uploaded6August2023) is an edited guide. Neither establishes a controlled natural
expiry. Extile's previously incomplete [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsA9ENMEQII)
is now recovered completely; its normal wake is consistent with known N/S faces,
but its countered/edited binding sequence does not resolve8versus9ticks. The earlier
incomplete-download note is historical, not the current source availability.

A ten-tile centre-distance probe was rejected as an oracle: the Wiki does not define
that distance convention for every direction and illustrates specific N/S lanes.
Review also caught stale compiled movement code after switching branches, so all
subsequent guard comparisons rebuild first. No binding/pursuit constant is changed
from those exploratory failures. Wake directions, optional-bind selection, natural
expiry, melee distribution/recovery and other listed numerical gaps remain open.

### Bind pursuit movement-pass alignment (24 October 2026)

The intended five-tick first step was one tick late in the encounter. World processes
NPC mechanics before player mechanics; the cathedral advances the fight from the
owner's player-area pass. Queueing a route on cast+5 therefore cannot move the NPC
until cast+6. The route is now prepared on+4 so the registered NPC first steps on+5.
The authored pursuitTicks5 is retained, and an already-adjacent target is still not
meleed before+5. No freeze, phase deadline, flight, damage or selection value changes.

This audit selects actual binding projectiles2467, then checks each actor's current
combat-level update. Across original [3281](https://rsprox.net/download/3281),
[3285](https://rsprox.net/download/3285) and[3299](https://rsprox.net/download/3299),
there are22normal791casts. Seventeen have a subsequent recorded walk, all first on
+5; five have no walk in the inspected14-tick window. The apparent+3cases instead
belong to fiveAwakened1146casts and are excluded. Animation masks can be replayed
when the player changes realm, so they are not treated as independent cast packets.
These are altered-world normal actors; the result supports this already-intended
first-step schedule, not all ordinary movement/counter timing or RNG.

Examples:3281cast2710 firstwalk2715;3285cast21929 firstwalk21934;3285cast22106
firstwalk22111;3299cast15300 firstwalk15305. The17movingcast ticks are
3281:2710/2844/2897/3057/3811/4482/5577/5812;
3285:21405/21484/21929/22106/22553/22603/22776/23058;
3299:15300. Excluded1146examples include3285:23306/23403 and3299:15652/15801/15943.
No sample-derived optional-bind probability is introduced.

Regressions run real NPC queues before player timers and fight processing, matching
World order. The first-step test failed on the old implementation (still stationary
at+5), then passed after correction. Adjacent melee remains+5. A real
CombatFactory.freezeTicks counter after route preparation cancels the queue, keeps
the NPC stationary and suppresses the in-flight player bind. Existing impact/phase
assertions remain; the old mock-route test now distinguishes queue preparation+4
from actual movement+5. Natural player expiry8versus9, optional binding selection,
post-melee recovery and the remaining ordinary numerical gaps remain unresolved.

## Paired melee retaliation, 24 October 2026

The current [Whisperer Speed-Runner strategy](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Whisperer_Speed-Runner)
explicitly recommends double Vengeance on the two equal melee hits. The prior
raw HitDamage path bypassed Vengeance and recoil entirely: real-player regressions
left Vengeance active and the boss at 900 HP despite damage to the player.

Both physical strikes now use the normal PendingHit/CombatFactory queue. Their
single original damage roll, partial-prayer snapshot and one-tick separation are
retained. A generic optional `PendingHitConfig.bypassProtectionPrayer` flag
(default false) prevents ordinary full prayer blocking from being reapplied to
the already mitigated amount. Armour effects occur once per impact; an actual
Elysian regression rejected a dummy zero-hit workaround that produced two effects.
The explicit flag also reaches multi-hit and first-success special roll paths;
callers that omit it retain existing behavior.

Real recoil and Vengeance regressions cover both strikes, rearmed Vengeance
between them, protected chip and ordinary hazard controls. Player HP and its
perfect-kill callback resolve before reflected damage reaches the next NPC pass.
A lethal reflected hit freezes the already-imperfect result and cancels the
second strike. Finish/departure zero both the pending parts and their cached
PendingHit total; otherwise a cancelled zero hit could still consume retaliation.
Applied hits release their tracked references.

Test fixtures now use the actual World clock when processing scheduled hits and
complete the binding test's setup teleport before accepting combat. Fresh build
and 85 Whisperer plus 7 HitQueue checks pass (92/92). Independent code review
found no important issue and independently repeated those 92 checks. Full-suite,
native staging and local integration results are reported with the PR.

This fixes the published retaliation behavior, not the unresolved melee damage
distribution, rounding, recovery, freeze duration or optional-bind RNG. No client,
Claude content or generated data is changed.
