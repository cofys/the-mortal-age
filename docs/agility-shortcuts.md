# Agility shortcuts: captured behaviour

The shortcuts live in `server/plugins/skills/data/agility-shortcuts.json` (format:
`server/plugins/skills/agility/README.md`). Entries with a `note` of `rsprox captures <ids>` were
rebuilt from live OSRS recordings (rsprox, revisions 223-239); the rest follow the Wiki and the map,
and say what is still a guess in `unverified`.

## How the captures were used

- **Per attempt, not merged:** each recording's events from the player's arrival (exact moves,
  animations, sounds, messages, teleports), tick by tick (`rsprox_index.py trace`). Merging
  attempts mixes up multi-step crossings such as the Barrows wall's run-up.
- **Normal worlds first:** Leagues and event worlds are used only where nothing else was recorded;
  the Nemus Retreat shortcuts are the only ones like that, and their `note` says so.
- **Step timing is the capture's:** the next step starts when the capture shows it, even when an
  exact move's cycles run longer (the North Iorwerth tight gap's crawl is cut short a tick in).
- **Ids by name:** every animation is resolved by its gamevals name in the rev-241 cache, not copied
  from the recording's revision. Sounds are recorded as ids only.
- **Tiles checked:** every end tile a capture moved was checked against the rev-241 collision map.
  The Varrock trellis lands on its own tile in the capture, which this map blocks, so it lands a
  tile further in.
- **XP stays the Wiki's:** some recordings are from Leagues, whose XP multipliers make the captured
  XP unreliable (the Barrows wall shows both +160 and +368 for the same crossing).
- **One direction captured:** the other mirrors it, and the entry says so in `unverified`.

## What the captures showed

| Shortcut | Captured |
| --- | --- |
| Obstacle pipes (Edgeville, Taverley, Yanille dungeons) | two 3-tile halves, each 749 from cycle 30 to 126, landing 4 ticks later with sound 2489; the second starts a tick after the first lands. The `pipe` builder does this for every pipe |
| Broken walls (Nemus Retreat) | 840 (`human_walk_crumbledwall`) over 70 cycles, sound 2453 |
| Tunnel (Nemus Retreat) | duck, crawl, emerge: three 1-tick moves, sound 2452 |
| Trellis (Varrock) | 12091 (`human_climb_trellis`), cycles 99-112, sound 2461 twice (the second 75 cycles in) |
| Cliff rocks (Aldarin, Ice Mountain, the Great Conch, Ralos' Rise) | down with 740, up with the climbing loop (4435), facing the cliff both ways, sound 2454 looped |
| Rocks (Trollheim, Crandor, Waterbirth Island) | 1148 over 120 cycles facing the cliff, sound 2454 |
| Dry stone wall (Barrows) | two steps back (820), a step's run-up (1995), then the hurdle (1603, cycles 8-50) over the wall; sound 1936; "You jump over the wall." a tick after the hurdle starts |
| Stepping stones (Necropolis, Wilderness Chaos Temple) | a jump (741) a stone every 2 ticks, sound 2461; Necropolis says "You attempt to cross using the stepping stone(s)..." and "You successfully make it to the other side." |
| Stepping stones (Lumbridge Swamp Caves) | two leaps with 769 (`human_steppingstonejump`), cycles 58-70, "You leap across with a mighty leap!" |
| Tunnels (Asgarnian Ice Dungeon) | the long crawl (2796) and a teleport; the wyvern tunnel shows four messages over 8 ticks |
| Crevices (Waterbirth, Shaman Caves), hole (Fossil Island), cave (Meiyerditch) | the crawl animation, a tick, the message and a teleport |
| Tight gaps (North and South Iorwerth Dungeon) | squeeze in, crawl, squeeze out, a tick apart; sounds 2489 and 2490; "You squeeze through the tight gap." |
| Chain (Chasm of Fire) | one way down: "You deftly slide down the chain, leaping off before landing on the cage.", sound 2461 and a teleport to the floor below |
| Jutting walls (Zanaris) | a 2-tile side-step from cycle 28 to 124, sound 2489 and "You try to squeeze past.", sound 2490 five ticks later |
| Strange floor (Fremennik Slayer Dungeon) | a 2-tile run-up (1995) with sound 2464, the 2-tile hurdle (1603) a tick later, both cycles 8-50 |
| Stepping stones (Karamja) | a stone a click: 769 with delay 20, cycles 48-60, sound 2461; "You attempt to balance on the stepping stone." and "You manage to make the jump." |
| Stepping stone (Pollnivneach) | onto the stone and a diagonal jump to the far bank, a jump every 2 ticks (741), sound 2461 |
| Rocks (Shilo Village) | rock tile to rock tile, 1148 over 90 cycles facing south |
| Rock slide (Cairn Isle) | 740 over 120 cycles, delay 15, facing west (only eastward recorded) |
| Climbing rocks (Yanille, Taverley), log balance (Fremennik) | only the sound and messages: walks and their animations are not in the recordings, so the movement stays a guess |
| Grapple walls (Falador, Yanille) | rev 237 (the newest): fire and climb in one animation (1779) with its graphic (3575) and sound 2928, a screen fade, the teleport onto the wall 7 ticks in (rev 230 took 10, with 4455/760). The fade isn't sent yet |
| Pillar (Ruins of Mokhaiotl) | a 3-tile jump (12196) in 27 cycles, sound 2461; a tick later varbit 16716 (`moki_agil_shortcut_side`) flips, so only the far pillar shows "Jump-to" (the runner's `varbit` step) |

## Still unverified, with what the captures show

- **Broken Raft, Crossbow Tree:** grapple, the rope added as scenery, the side panels hidden, a
  swim along the rope (their own swimming animations) and a chance the grapple breaks. Needs its
  own script.
- **Gap (Chasm of Fire):** only event-world recordings, and the recorded moves and the server
  position disagree by a tile or two.
- **Mysterious pipe (Mount Karuulm):** its messages are chatbox message boxes and the minimap is
  hidden, which the step format can't express yet.
- **Wall (Darkmeyer):** recorded climbing up (39173, `human_reachforladder`, then a teleport to
  3595,3312 a tick later), but that half is on plane 1 and the other (39172) on plane 0; where the
  player stands needs another look. Not added.
- **No usable recording:** Crevices (Wilderness Slayer Cave) (5)-(8), Rocks (Trollheim hard and
  advanced).

## Map mismatches found on the way

Every entry's `at` tile was checked against the rev-241 cache's placements.

- **Fixed:** the Yanille wall and its battlements are on 2556,3073 and 3074 (the entries said 3072
  and 3075), so grappling up and jumping down there did nothing.
- **Not fixed yet:** "Rocks (dense essence mine, north/south side)" point at 1761,3872-3873, where
  the rock is 34741, not their 27984/27985; and the 12 "Hole (Draynor Manor and Falador walls)"
  tiles have no hole in the cache at all (12656 is only placed at 2344,3651).
